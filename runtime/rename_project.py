# rename_project.py ---  Perform all tasks required for renaming a project.
#
# In the context of this script, "renaming" a project means changing the
# 'ip-name' entry in the JSON file and all that that implies.  To create a
# new project with an existing ip-name is essentially a trivial process of
# renaming the parent directory.
#
# Note that when a catalog entry is generated in the marketplace, the entry's
# default name is taken from the parent directory name, not the ip-name.  The
# resulting entry name is irrelevant to most everything except how and where
# the IP is listed in the catalog.  The read-only IP version has the name of
# the ip-name.  Implies it is important that ip-name does not collide with
# the ip-name of anything else in the marketplace catalog (but this is not
# currently enforced).
#
# Modified 12/20/2018: New protocol is that the .json file is always called
# 'project.json' and does not take the name of the parent directory.  This
# makes projects more portable.
